Notes from Florin Isaila re: adding new counters as of 2014/03/06
---------------

1. Added the counters in darshan-log-format.h
2. Added the names of the counters in darshan-util/darshan-logutils.c
3. Added the new profiled function declarations (e.g., PMPI_Sent) in
darshan-runtime/darshan-dynamic.h
 - DARSHAN_EXTERN_DECL(...)
4. Added the new profiled function declarations (e.g., PMPI_Sent) in
darshan-runtime/lib/darshan-mpi-init-finalize.c 
 - DARSHAN_FORWARD_DECL(...)
 - MAP_OR_FAIL(...)
5. Updated the reducer in darshan-runtime/lib/darshan-mpi-io.c in the
function: 
 static void darshan_file_reduce(void* infile_v, 
   void* inoutfile_v, int *len, 
   MPI_Datatype *datatype);
