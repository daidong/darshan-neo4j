Darshan Release Change Log
--------------------------

darshan-2.3.0
=============
* Fix incorrect version numbering in darshan-runtime component of Darshan
  2.2.9, reported by Jean-Guillaume Piccinali

darshan-2.2.9
=============
* Bug fixes:
  - Fix mnt table overflow if a large number of file systems are mounted, 
    reported by David Shrader.
  - Fix argument parsing for darshan-convert, reported by Mouhamed Gueye.
  - Fix metadata annotation overflow in darshan-convert, reported by 
    Mouhamed Gueye.
  - Fix const-correctness in dynamic library when built against MPI 3.x
    libraries.
  - Fix "undefined symbol: dlsym" error when using preloaded dynamic library
    on some platforms, reported by Florin Isaila.
  - Normalize timestamps to always be relative to MPI_Init().
  - Better library name matching in compiler wrappers to handle more MPICH
    variations on Blue Gene systems.
  - Fixed header dependency problems when using darshan-logutils.h in external
    programs (Shane Snyder).
* Enhancements:
  - Add support (both in documentation and in provided module files) for
    Cray PE 2.x.
  - Honor CC variable to allow darshan-util to be built with other compilers
    besides gcc.
  - Update documentation to clarify the interaction between rpath and
    LD_PRELOAD when instrumenting dynamic libraries, issue reported and
    investigated by Davide Del Vento.
  - Ability to disable shared-file reduction by setting the
    DARSHAN_DISABLE_SHARED_REDUCTION environment variable.
  - More thorough output from darshan-parser --perf, suggested by Huong Luu.
  - Increased metadata annotation room from 64 bytes to 1KiB in header.
  - CP_F_{FASTEST/SLOWEST}_RANK_TIME counters now take MPI-IO time into
    account, not just POSIX time, issue reported by Huong Luu.
  - Better handling of systems with many mounted file systems (after which
    point Darshan will assume file resides on / file system), issue reported
    and investigated by David Shrader:
    - Track up to 64 rather than 32 mounted file systems at runtime.
    - Increase header space available for storing mount point information in
      log file from approximately 1 KiB to approximately 3 KiB.
    - Prioritize storing information about non-NFS volumes over NFS volumes
      if too many file systems are mounted to record them all.
  - Added darshan-util pkgconfig file (Shane Snyder).
  - Added --enable-shared configure option to darshan-util to build and
    a shared library version of libdarshan-util

darshan-2.2.8
=============
* WARNING: please note that the Darshan module file for Cray environments has
  been updated, especially in the DARSHAN_POST_LINK_OPTS variable.  Please
  update your module file accordingly when upgrading from 2.2.7 or earlier 
  on Cray platforms.
* Improved ability to analyze I/O activity related to particular files 
  opened by an application
  - darshan-summary-per-file.sh script to generate a separate pdf summary for
    each file opened by an application. Developed by Rob Latham.
  - Added --file-list and --file-list-detailed options to darshan-parser to 
    list files opened by an application along with brief statistics
  - Added --file option to darshan-convert to filter out activity for a
    specific file from a Darshan log
* Add wrappers for POSIX AIO operations (fixes tracking of underlying POSIX
  operations resulting from nonblocking MPI-IO operations.  Bug reported by
  David Shrader.)
* Fix compile-time errors when Darshan is configured for use with MPICH 3.x 
  installations with const correct MPI function prototypes. Also affects 
  MPICH 1.5+ installations with optional const support.  Reported by Yushu Yao.
* Fix segmentation fault when using LD_PRELOAD instrumentation on programs
  that use MPI_Init_thread() rather than MPI_Init().  Reported by Myriam
  Botalla.

darshan-2.2.7
=============
* Updated Cray installation documentation for cleaner integration in Cray
  environments
* Fix bug that recorded incorrect device ID (and therefore incorrect mount
  point mapping) if stat() was called before open() on a file
* Store version number of the darshan runtime library in the log file 
  metadata (see lib_ver in darshan-parser output)

darshan-2.2.6
=============
* Bug fixes:
  - make sure to honor user-specified hints passed in at runtime
    via the DARSHAN_LOGHINTS env variable.
  - include fread and fwrite in darshan-job-summary.pl read and write counts
  - fix segmentation fault on invalid arguments to darshan-parser
* Performance enhancements:
  - collect mount point information at rank 0 and broadcast to all 
    processes to avoid excess file system traffic on startup
  - change default MPI-IO hints for writing log file to
    romio_no_indep_rw=true and cb_nodes=4 to improve log creation performance
* Install libdarshan-util and headers during installation process for
  darshan-util; patch contributed by Matthieu Dorier
* Detect PMPI support at link time when using compiler scripts produced
  by the darshan-gen-* utilities.  This avoids link problems when Darshan
  compiler wrappers are used with the ADIOS dummy MPI library; reported
  by Jingqing Mu
* Support MPICH_{CC/CXX/F77} environment variables in compiler scripts
  produced by the darshan-gen-* utilities
* Add instrumentation of startup time, enabled via DARSHAN_INTERNAL_TIMING
  environment variable
* Rename cp-shutdown-bench test utility to darshan-shutdown-bench and enable
  benchmarking hooks in library by default so that darshan-shutdown-bench 
  can be used with any Darshan installation
* Remove deprecated --enable-st-dev-workaround configure option
* Misc. documentation updates

darshan-2.2.5
=============
* Fix bug in mount point identification when --enable-stat-at-open option is
  not used.  In Darshan 2.2.4, some file entries were recorded as using the "/"
  file system regardless of their location.
* Update patches and documentation for Cray xt-asyncpe environment 5.12 or 
  higher; contributed by Yushu Yao.
* Update documentation to no longer recommend --enable-stat-at-open option on 
  any systems
* Fix unresolved symbols error when linking non-MPI programs with Cray
  compiler.  Reported by Yushu Yao.
* Use fstat() in place of stat() for detecting file information when
  --enable-stat-at-open option is used
* Use statfs() at startup to detect default block size for supported file
  systems
* Added --enable-group-readable-logs configure option, which will cause
  Darshan to to generate log files with the group read permission bit set.
  This option is useful in conjunction with deployments that set the setgid
  bit on log directories.

darshan-2.2.4
=============
* Disable extra stat() of newly opened files by default.  This improves 
  performance on shared files for some platforms.  Reported by Yushu Yao.
  - prevents Darshan from reporting SIZE_AT_OPEN, FILE_ALIGNENT, and 
    DARSHAN_FILE_NOT_ALIGNED values
  - features can still be enabled via --enable-stat-at-open option
* Fix missing -lz in post ld flags reported by Yushu Yao.  Fixes a link-time
  error for some corner-case applications.
* Fix bug in Cray compiler script patches that was setting compiler flags 
  incorrectly.  Reported by Yushu Yao.
  WARNING: if you are using a previous Darshan release (2.2.3 through
  2.2.4-pre4) on a Cray platform, please re-patch your compiler scripts.
* Update darshan-gen-* scripts to support the potential for additonal LDFLAGS
  or CFLAGS that appear before the object or source file in the compile or
  link commands.  This fixes compatibility with some mvapich2 installations,
  reported by Dragos Constantin.

darshan-2.2.3
=============
* improved Cray XE6 support
  - support for GNU, PGI, Cray, Pathscale, and Intel compilers
  - patch adding Darshan capability to system compiler scripts

  - improve timing mechanism for cp-shutdown-bench benchmark
  - improve hashing to avoid log file name collisions

darshan-2.2.2
=============
* bug fixes:
  - remove debugging message that was inadvertently included in
    MPI_File_sync() wrapper
  - fix potential hang if the --with-log-path-by-env argument was used at 
    configure time but the environment variable was not set at run time

    Cray environments
  - build problems with darshan-utils on some versions of OSX
  - accurate shared file statistics for libraries that use deferred opens

darshan-2.2.0
=============
* split darshan into separate packages:
  - darshan-runtime: for runtime instrumentation
  - darshan-utils: for processing darshan log files
* changed default output file name for darshan-job-summary.pl to be based on
  input file name rather than summary.pdf
* reorganized init and finalize routines so that can be linked separately (to
  allow for easier integration with other instrumentation tools)
* add -cc, -cxx, -f77, -f90, and -fc support to compiler scripts generated by
  the darshan-gen-*.pl scripts

* bug fix to variance/minimum calculations on shared files
* switch to automatic generation of all MPI compiler scripts using
  darshan-gen-* tools
* new run time environment variable: DARSHAN_INTERNAL_TIMING.  If set at job
  execution time, it will cause Darshan to time its own internal data 
  aggregation routines and print the results to stdout at rank 0.

darshan-2.0.0

  NOTE: Darshan 1.x output files are incompatible with the tools in this 
  release unless they were generated on a ppc32 architecture (Blue Gene)
* 8 new counters that record the rank of the fastest and slowest process that
  opened each shared file, along with the number of seconds and number of
  bytes consumed by those processes.  It also reports the variance in both
  time and amount of data.
