\section{Conclusion \& Future Work}

In this paper, we proposed an idea of unifying rich metadata in a HPC platform into a property graph model, which supports a wide range of metadata management requirements in a simple and efficient way. By prototyping such a metadata graph from Darshan I/O traces of a real world leading supercomputer, we explorer the attributes of such graphs and compare it with some popular big graphs. After that, we introduce the existed graph facilities and discuss their feasibilities and limitations in our scenario. In general, we argue the benefits of unifying HPC metadata into a graph and also present the feasibility of implementing such a graph in current HPC platform. In future, the work will be implementing such a platform with optimized or tweaked graph facilities and provide a practical metadata solution for Exscale data management challenge.
