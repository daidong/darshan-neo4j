HPC platforms are capable of generating huge amounts of metadata about different entities including jobs, processes, users, and files etc. \textit{Simple metadata}, which describes the attributes of these entities has already been widely used, like the file size, name and permission mode. On the other hand, the \textit{rich metadata}, which records not only the attributes of entities but also relationships among them, is still missing in most HPC systems. For example, the rich metadata \textit{provenance}, which records the entire life cycle of data objects, is not well supported, even given the fact that provenance provides many appealing data management functionalities, such as determining the quality of the data set, finding the source of data corruption, and tracing all data dependency etc. The main challenge is that the rich metadata can be too flexible to define and collect in general: they may contain arbitrary information and come from different system components or even users applications. Collecting, storing, and processing such rich metadata will place huge pressure on the HPC platform.

In this paper, we propose \textit{gRMM}, a rich metadata management solution that abstracts all the metadata (both the \textit{simple and rich metadata}) into one generic and flexible property graph-based model. We show that \textit{gRMM} can be leveraged to efficiently support simple metadata operations, including directory namespace, permission validation etc., and also support rich metadata processing, especially the provenance storage and query. We also present the detailed design for integrating \textit{gRMM} into current HPC platform efficiently.
